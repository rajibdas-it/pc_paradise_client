Whatever your storage acceleration needs, AMD StoreMI technology automatically pairs your most-used files with an SSD cache for peak performance. the Zen-3 architecture is a ground-up redesign of the legendary Zen family. Equipped with end-to-end design enhancements, Zen 3 embodies AMDs relentless focus on single-core performance, energy efficiency, and reduced latencies. It is at the core of the best gaming processors in the world. The Zen-3 architecture can extract an average of 19% additional performance from every MHz of frequency relative to the previous generation. The Zen-3 architecture transitions to a new unified complex design that brings 8 cores and 32MB of L3 cache into a single group of resources. This dramatically reduces core-to-core and core-to-cache latencies by making every element of the die a next-door neighbor with minimal communication time. Latency-sensitive tasks like PC gaming especially benefit from this change, as tasks now have direct access to twice as much L3 cache versus the older Zen 2.
